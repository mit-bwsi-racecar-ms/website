What is RMS?
------------------------------
`Racecar Middle School <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/intro/welcome.html>`_, or RMS, is a STEM program designed for middle school students (grades 6 - 8) to learn programming and robotics through interactive, project-based labs. This course requires no previous experience to follow. 

RMS introduces students gradually to python programming, computer vision, and robotics concepts through hands-on activities and labs. By the end of the course, students will be able to program a robotic car to self-navigate a race course. This course was developed through the `Beaver Works Summer Institute <https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/bwsi>`_ (BWSI). 



Class Types
------------------------------
Online Course (online, self-guided)
	- This online, self-guided curriculum for middle school students uses a project-based approach to teach students STEM, programming, and team-building skills while they build a low-cost, driverless model car. The online curriculum was developed with the goal of enabling any interested middle school student to learn how to build and program their very own self-driving racecars. The website course materials is built from that used in the Summer Course. 

Crash Course (8 weeks, weekly)
	- This 8-week crash course teaches middle school students (6th-8th grade) the fundamentals of programming, computer vision, and robotics. RMS Crash Course is a middle school outreach program that focuses on improving diversity in STEM through robotics education. The course focuses on interest-building and exposure. Local middle school students attend eight, 3-hour hands-on sessions on Saturday mornings. 

Summer Course (4 weeks, daily)
	- This 4-week robotics course introduces local middle school students (6th-8th grade) to Python, OpenCV, and the RACECAR platform. This month-long, intensive course is held during the month of July through the BeaverWorks Summer Institute (BWSI). The curriculum culminates in a final "Mini Grand Prix" in which students program a robot to autonomously navigate through an obstacle course.



Previous Classes Taught
------------------------------
RMS was developed in Summer 2019 as a BWSI pilot middle school program, with the goal to develop a curriculum that can reach and inspire underserved students in STEM. We have since ran a number of different iterations of RMS since then. The brochures and schedule of topics for each iteration taught can be found below:

	- Fall 2019 (8 weeks, weekly) - `F19 Brochure <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1H0VLyKs8-WbNlk4RjzknRtsyomJ-q-EW>`_, `F19 Schedule <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ac_2xJJAhlCd8aHTIsosuboxl-Vv6-fnAXy9pLDKnSI>`_    
	- Summer 2019 (4 weeks, daily) - `S19 Brochure <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jl_3dGFktnbw4pnso2nudXNiUxapPP2c>`_, `S19 schedule <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dn_59_K70GzrlK41tRb18IMqo1VS70n0K63iNsJIQRM>`_



Some Statistics
------------------------------
Students filled out self-assessments on the first and last day of the RMS Summer 2019 class. The questionnaire asked students about their comfortability with specific topics taught in class. Students their comfortability from 1 (never heard of it) to 5 (expert). Based on student feedback, students who finished the curriculum felt a general increase in confidence and comfortability with programming, python, opencv, and robotics. For more details, check out the Student Feedback in the RMS Overview slides above (slides 55 - 59).
